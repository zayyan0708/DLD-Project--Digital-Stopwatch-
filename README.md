# DLD Project (Digital Stopwatch)
 
This project is a digital stopwatch that uses several electronic components to accurately measure and display time. The project utilizes 3&4 bit JK flip flop as the synchronize counter to count numbers which are then sent to the BCD decoder. NOR and NAND gates are used for the clock for minutes and hours and clock for seconds. Additionally, 6 7-Segment Displays are used to show the presentation of time period. Finally, SPST switch is used for pausing the clock and additional switches are used to reset the stopwatch.

## Components Used
• 3&4 bit JK flip flop as the synchronize counter \
• BCD decoder \
• NOR and NAND gates for clock for minutes and hours and clock for seconds \
• 6 7-Segment Displays for displaying time period \
• SPST switch for pausing the clock \
• Additional switches for resetting the stopwatch \
## How it Works
The digital stopwatch uses a series of electronic components to measure and display time. The 3&4 bit JK flip flop as the synchronize counter counts the numbers, which are then sent to the BCD decoder. NOR and NAND gates control the clock for minutes and hours and clock for seconds. The 6 7-Segment Displays display the time period in an easily readable format.

To pause the clock, an SPST switch is used. Additional switches are used to reset the stopwatch to its starting position.

## Conclusion
This digital stopwatch project is an efficient and accurate way to measure time. By utilizing electronic components such as 3&4 bit JK flip flop, BCD decoder, NOR and NAND gates, 6 7-Segment Displays, and switches, the project is able to provide an accurate and user-friendly experience. The digital stopwatch can be used for a variety of purposes, such as timing athletic events, cooking, or simply for personal use.
